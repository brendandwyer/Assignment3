Project defines a large 2D array of seats. Commands are read from an input file and operations are
performed on the spaces. Finally, a final function returns the number of seats occupied at the end
of the string of commands. In this case the number was 645 but some bugs in the program were really
troublesome so that's unlikely to be correct.
